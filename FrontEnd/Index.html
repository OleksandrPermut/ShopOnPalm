                    One of the reasons I have chosen to do this project is due to my working experience in one construction site company. It has nothing to do with the content within my application but the idea was taken from them. I have found out that the company i was working in use this kind of system to track which companies occupy which platforms for constructions. Following that I have a good friend of mine who works as a manager in Novus shops in my country. Novus is a big network of grocery stores and this friend has told me that having something like this app to know in which cities which store are placed would be good. From that point i have thought why not create something like that.
