Project Background
The inspiration for my project came from my previous work experience at a construction site company. Although unrelated to the content of my application, I noticed that the company used a similar system to track which companies occupied specific platforms for constructions. Additionally, a friend of mine who manages Novus shops, a large network of grocery stores in my country, suggested the idea of having an app to track store locations and prices across different cities. This sparked my interest, and I decided to create an application to address these needs.

Application Overview
The main purpose of my app is to track the placement of grocery stores in different cities and provide information on product prices, which tend to vary across locations. The app will serve as a centralized database for store, product, and pricing information. Its target users are managers in major grocery networks, enabling them to easily monitor their own stores and stay informed about competitors' prices. This functionality is crucial in today's competitive market, where maintaining price competitiveness is vital.

App Features
The app offers a user-friendly interface and straightforward functionality. Users can create a new store and assign it a name and city. They can then navigate to the products section to view a list of available products and those already sold in the store. Users have the option to create new products or select existing ones from the available list to add to the store's inventory. All stores and products can be edited, updated, or deleted as needed.
